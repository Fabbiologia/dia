\title{Run adult passage inefficiency}
\usage{
run_inefficiency(n, inefficiency_matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{A vector of length 15 containing total number of fish that failed to
pass dams and did not die or return to sea.}

\item{inefficiency_matrix}{A matrix identical in structure to the built-in
\code{\link{inefficiency_matrix}} dataset (NMFS 2012; Neiland et al. 2013).}
}
\description{
Adult inefficiency (homing) routine for Atlantic salmon that 
fail to pass a dam but that also do not die or return to sea.
}
\examples{
# Simulate 10,000 starting fish at each dam and
# randomly sample number of failures for each PU (15 of these)

failures = sample(1e4, 15, replace = TRUE)

# Use run_inefficiency to simulate where these 
# failed migrants end up in the watershed based on the 
# default inefficiency_matrix in dia.

run_inefficiency(failures, dia::inefficiency_matrix)
