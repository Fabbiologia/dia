\title{Run adult straying routine}
\usage{
run_straying(returns, straying_matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{returns}{Total number of fish returning to river by production unit.}

\item{straying_matrix}{A matrix identical in structure to the built-in
\code{\link{straying_matrix}} dataset.}
}
\value{
A vector containing a number of adults of starting total (sum of all
15 production units) that end up in each PU after straying.
}
\description{
